Brute force attack in python (ONLY USE FOR TESTING PURPOSES AND NOT FOR ANY ILLEGAL PURPOSES)
use this code if you want to test if your websites login system can handle a smaller brute force attack, or for learning how these work.
Do not attack anyones website if you dont have written permission from the owner. But i suggest only use this on localhost or maybe your own domain.
